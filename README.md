Hello and welcome to the code behind my [Portfolio website](https://mmorris-sandbox.net). This frontend loads data from a vanilla Drupal installation. It is built on [NextJS](https://next.js) and hosted on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?filter=next.js).

If you would like to try out the Automated tests of this project you'll need to check out a local copy.  After cloning the repository and running `npm install` you can run the development server locally with `npm run dev`. The tests can be invoked with `npm test`.

I am currently looking for work.  My portfolio is the most comprhensive review of my skills, but for those who prefer printable resumes I [have one here](https://mmorris-sandbox.net/resume.pdf).
