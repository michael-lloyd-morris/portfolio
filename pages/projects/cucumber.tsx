        <p>As web applications have grown in size and complexity the task of thoroughly testing them has grown more difficult. For this task I turn to the various dialects of Cucumber using the Behavior Driven Development approach to software. While I have used Cucumber on PHP and Java, it is only on JavaScript that have contributed back. So far my commits have been to improve documentation - but I am currently working on two issue tickets involving the behavior of the test code. When those issues are commited into the core I'll provide more details here.</p>
